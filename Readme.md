### The Indian Bible
# Mamusse wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God

The first Bible printed in North America translated by John Eliot, Puritan minister and an outspoken supporter of Christian missionary work among local Native American tribes. In the 1650s, he began translating parts of the Bible into Wôpanâak with significant help from Native linguists. This language, sometimes known as Massachusett, is a part of the Algonquian family of languages. He published the New Testament in 1661 and the entire Bible in 1663.
